# Cross-Layer Thinking Guide

> **Purpose**: Think through data flow across layers before implementing.

---

## The Problem

**Most bugs happen at layer boundaries**, not within layers.

Common cross-layer bugs:
- API returns format A, frontend expects format B
- Database stores X, service transforms to Y, but loses data
- Multiple layers implement the same logic differently

---

## Before Implementing Cross-Layer Features

### Step 1: Map the Data Flow

Draw out how data moves:

```
Source → Transform → Store → Retrieve → Transform → Display
```

For each arrow, ask:
- What format is the data in?
- What could go wrong?
- Who is responsible for validation?

### Step 2: Identify Boundaries

| Boundary | Common Issues |
|----------|---------------|
| API ↔ Service | Type mismatches, missing fields |
| Service ↔ Database | Format conversions, null handling |
| Backend ↔ Frontend | Serialization, date formats |
| Component ↔ Component | Props shape changes |

### Step 3: Define Contracts

For each boundary:
- What is the exact input format?
- What is the exact output format?
- What errors can occur?

---

## Common Cross-Layer Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Implicit Format Assumptions

**Bad**: Assuming date format without checking

**Good**: Explicit format conversion at boundaries

### Mistake 2: Scattered Validation

**Bad**: Validating the same thing in multiple layers

**Good**: Validate once at the entry point

### Mistake 3: Leaky Abstractions

**Bad**: Component knows about database schema

**Good**: Each layer only knows its neighbors

## Checklist for Cross-Layer Features

Before implementation:
- [ ] Mapped the complete data flow
- [ ] Identified all layer boundaries
- [ ] Defined format at each boundary
- [ ] Decided where validation happens

After implementation:
- [ ] Tested with edge cases (null, empty, invalid)
- [ ] Verified error handling at each boundary
- [ ] Checked data survives round-trip

For provider tool calls, also apply the executable rules in
[`backend/provider-tool-replay-contract.md`](../backend/provider-tool-replay-contract.md):

- [ ] One shared output bound is enforced before persistence and again at the storage boundary
- [ ] Every terminal turn closes all pending tool calls before its terminal transition
- [ ] Replay repairs only terminal legacy gaps and never fabricates results for active calls
- [ ] Provider failures retain only allowlisted, bounded structured diagnostics
- [ ] Provider-specific wire behavior is selected at the registry boundary and tested through the
      resolved provider, not only through a directly constructed adapter

For durable TUI transcript projection:

- [ ] Compare the live event path with the SQLite-to-snapshot resume path using the same message
      and tool sequence
- [ ] Do not overload assistant text as tool labels, targets, arguments, or result summaries
- [ ] Repair malformed legacy display rows in the read projection without rewriting append-only
      canonical history
- [ ] Allowlist structured display metadata and verify raw arguments and private rationale stay out
      of readable snapshots

## Atomic Acceptance And Durable Ownership

When an API or gateway accepts work that depends on a durable reservation, the
reservation is part of the acceptance boundary.

### Checklist: Accepting Idempotent Work

- [ ] Perform the fingerprint check and reservation in one atomic storage
  operation before returning success
- [ ] Do not use `load` followed by a later `reserve`; that creates a TOCTOU
  window across processes
- [ ] Carry the exact reservation result into asynchronous execution instead
  of reserving a second time
- [ ] Map reservation conflicts to request-level errors before publishing an
  accepted response
- [ ] Test two independent callers sharing the real or equivalent atomic
  reservation boundary; require exactly one acceptance

### Checklist: Recovering In-Progress Work

- [ ] Persist enough owner identity to distinguish orphaned work from another
  live process's work
- [ ] Recover only unowned work or work whose owner is known to be dead
- [ ] Release only the current owner's records during graceful shutdown
- [ ] Test concurrent live owners and dead-owner recovery separately
- [ ] Keep recovery and terminal-state writes in short atomic transactions

**Real-world example**: The Node runtime gateway initially returned `accepted`
after a non-atomic pre-read, while the runtime reserved the turn later. Two
processes could both accept a conflicting `client_turn_id`. Startup recovery
also treated every `in_progress` row as orphaned, so a second CLI could
interrupt a live first CLI. The fix made reservation part of synchronous
gateway acceptance, passed that reservation into asynchronous execution, and
recorded store owner identity for liveness-aware recovery.

## Cross-Platform Template Consistency

In Trellis, command templates (e.g., `record-session.md`) exist in **multiple platforms** with identical or near-identical content. This is a cross-layer boundary.

### Checklist: After Modifying Any Command Template

- [ ] Find all platforms with the same command: `find src/templates/*/commands/trellis/ -name "<command>.*"`
- [ ] Update all platform copies (Markdown `.md` and TOML `.toml`)
- [ ] For Gemini TOML: adapt line continuations (`\\` vs `\`) and triple-quoted strings
- [ ] Run `/trellis:check-cross-layer` to verify nothing was missed

**Real-world example**: Updated `record-session.md` in Claude to use `--mode record`, but forgot iFlow, Kilo, OpenCode, and Gemini — caught by cross-layer check.

---

## Generated Runtime Template Upgrade Consistency

Some generated files are both documentation and runtime input. In Trellis,
`.trellis/workflow.md` is parsed by `get_context.py`, `workflow_phase.py`,
SessionStart filters, and per-turn hooks. Template changes must be validated
against both fresh init and upgrade paths.

### Checklist: After Modifying A Runtime-Parsed Template

- [ ] Identify every runtime parser that reads the template, not just the file
  writer that installs it
- [ ] Check whether relevant syntax lives outside obvious managed regions
  such as tag blocks
- [ ] Verify fresh `init` output and a versioned `update` scenario that writes
  the older `.trellis/.version`
- [ ] Add an upgrade regression using an older pristine template fixture, then
  assert the installed file reaches the current packaged shape
- [ ] Update the backend spec that owns the runtime contract

**Real-world example**: Codex inline mode changed workflow platform markers from
`[Codex]` / `[Kilo, Antigravity, Windsurf]` to `[codex-sub-agent]` /
`[codex-inline, Kilo, Antigravity, Windsurf]`. Fresh init was correct, but
`trellis update` only merged `[workflow-state:*]` blocks and preserved stale
markers outside those blocks. Result: upgraded projects got new hook scripts
but old workflow routing, so `get_context.py --mode phase --platform codex`
could return empty Phase 2.1 detail.

## Mode-Detection Probe Checklist

When a CLI auto-detects a mode by probing a remote resource (e.g., checking if `index.json` exists to decide marketplace vs direct download):

### Before implementing:
- [ ] Probe runs in **ALL** code paths that use the result (interactive, `-y`, `--flag` combos)
- [ ] 404 vs transient error are distinguished — don't treat both as "not found"
- [ ] Transient errors **abort or retry**, never silently switch modes
- [ ] Shared state (caches, prefetched data) is **reset** when context changes (e.g., user switches source)
- [ ] **Shortcut paths** (e.g., `--template` skipping picker) must have the same error-handling quality as the probed path — check that downstream functions don't call catch-all wrappers

### After implementing:
- [ ] Trace every path from probe result to the mode-decision branch — no fallthrough
- [ ] External format contracts (giget URI, raw URLs) are tested or at least documented as comments
- [ ] Metadata reads consume a complete response or use a streaming parser — never parse a fixed-size prefix as full JSON
- [ ] When reconstructing a composite identifier from parsed parts, verify **all** fields are included and in the **correct position** (e.g., `provider:repo/path#ref` not `provider:repo#ref/path`)
- [ ] Verify that **action functions** called after a shortcut don't internally use the old catch-all fetch — they must use the probe-quality variant when error distinction matters

**Real-world example**: Custom registry flow had 8 bugs across 3 review rounds: (1) probe only ran in interactive mode, (2) transient errors fell through to wrong mode, (3) giget URI had `#ref` in wrong position, (4) prefetched templates leaked across source switches, (5) `--template` shortcut bypassed probe but `downloadTemplateById` internally used catch-all `fetchTemplateIndex`, turning timeouts into "Template not found".

**Real-world example**: Agent-session update hints fetched npm `latest` metadata with `response.read(4096)` and then parsed it as complete JSON. The `@mindfoldhq/trellis` package metadata exceeded 4 KB, so the JSON was truncated, parse failed silently, and the first session injection showed no update hint. Fix: read the complete response before parsing, and add a regression where `version` is followed by an 8 KB metadata tail.

## When to Create Flow Documentation

Create detailed flow docs when:
- Feature spans 3+ layers
- Multiple teams are involved
- Data format is complex
- Feature has caused bugs before
